Hi, I'm Alan, a **Master's Student** in computer science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), with a keen interest in AI, paticularly in Deep Learning. I'm currently work as a Research Intern at [Efficient And Intelligent Computing Lab](https://eiclab.scs.gatech.edu/), where my work focuses on adversarial attacks and the activation patterns in LLMs. I also have a board interest in learning algorithms. 

Before diving into the world of AI, I worked as a R&D engineer and here's some of [my work](/personalweb/blog/2024/Portfolio-Highlights-at-CADG/). Outside of academics and research, I enjoy studying Spanish, reading poetry, and playing tennis.
