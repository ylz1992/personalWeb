Hey there! I'm Alan, and this is my little corner of the internet. I'm currently a **MSCS** student at **georgia tech**, diving into the world of Machine Learning and Computing Systems. Currently seeking exciting research opportunties in tech, especially with a focus on ML and AI, as I gear up for PhD adventures. Got any tips or leads? Let's chat!

Before joining GT, I was out there making sure buildings didn't fall down as a structural engineer. If you're curious about my past adventures in engineering, feel free to take a sneak peek [right here](../_posts/2024-03-26-MLProject.md). And befor that, I got MS in Geotechnical Engineering from the University of Florida, and BS from Beijing Jiaotong University.
