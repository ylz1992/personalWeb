Hi, this is Alan. I'm currently a MSCS student at georgia tech, specializing in computing systems and machine learning. My primary interests lie in ML and AI, and eager to conduct research in these area. Before joining GT, I was a structural engineer in complex building designs, and main designer for National Alpha Sking Center for 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. And befor that, I got MS in geotechnical engineering from University of Florida, and BS of science from Beijing Jiaotong University.
