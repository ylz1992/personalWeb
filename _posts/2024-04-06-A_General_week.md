Congrats! I found a new studio @ Home Park! Finally I got a place to park my car ~ Thanks Mohammad.

It's been 4 months since I came to Atlanta. To be honest, It's been like trying to assemble IKEA funiture without the instructions, challenging but oddly rewarding definitely. I suppose that's the most amazing part of a career transition? Millions of time, I channel my inner Chris from 'The Pursuit of Happyness', thinking how hard chasing happiness with my barefoot. But lo, happiness was chilling in my backyard all along. I have a lovely girlfriend who's about to upgrade to my wife (hopefully nothing going wrong!!), a perfect bodyshape (someone would say it "art"), and the chance to dive headfirst into an exciting study area (yes! Machine Learning) that could one day spell my name correctly on a diploma. You got me? life's good.  

Ever since I decided to keep pursuing a PhD (I know I'm going crazy humm...), finding a research intern for the summer has been like so hard. I've sent emails to some professors, persused papers till my eyes crossed, but my inbox is like a ghost town. Shoutout to Prof. Hoffman for her lighting fast rejection, for not letting me blame Microsoft Outlook. But hey, no hard feelings, my majestic PhD plan won't be stuck here for too long (hopefully). And I'll start working during the summer no matter what. Planning for 24Fall RA position I suppose. 

A heartfelt apology to Xixi, who's been a champion at enduring the agony of separation. Darling, your sacrifice hasn't gone unnoticed, especially when it comes to sharing roast duck with me while I'm eating **** Pandas. I owe you big. Love you Xixi! 

Time sneaking out. I need get back. I can't guarantee I'll snag any life changing opportunities, but I can promise not to waste any precious moments. Life is meaningless, but at least I won't make it boring.
