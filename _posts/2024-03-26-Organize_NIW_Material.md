## Overview
During working at [China Architecture Design & Research Group (CADG)](https://cadg.com.cn/en/about/) from 2017 to 2023, I worked in the Renqingying Structural Studio as a Structural Engineer under the leadership of Ren Qingying, a National Engineering Survey and Design Master. I contributed to some of China’s most prestigious construction projects, which helped shape me into a highly skilled engineer. CADG, a national-owned enterprise, is renowned for its expertise in architecture, urban planning, and engineering, with a history of completing significant national projects. My work there involved tackling complex challenges and delivering top-tier design solutions, reflecting CADG’s commitment to excellence in the construction industry.

## Reserch Topic
#### Key Technologies for the Design, Construction, and Operation of Winter Olympic Snow Venues under Complex Mountainous Conditions
National Founded Key R&D Program “Science and Technology for Winter Olympics” Special Project. This project addresses the gap in experience with designing and constructing Olympic-standard snow sports venues. Through an integrated research approach covering planning, design, venue construction, and engineering implementation, the project has developed comprehensive systems for the design, construction, and operation of alpine skiing and bobsleigh venues. Additionally, it has established innovative technologies for harmonizing Winter Olympic venues with the surrounding ecological environment and proposed a sustainable legacy utilization framework that spans the entire lifecycle from planning to post-Games operations.

#### The research on key technologies for the industrialization of new reinforced concrete structures in residential buildings
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive industrialization system for residential buildings, centered around prefabricated technology. It addresses key challenges in prefabricated concrete structures by developing new wall, floor, and joint systems for reinforced concrete box structures. Through experimental research, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulations, the project validates the load-bearing and seismic performance of these systems, deriving calculation methods and establishing a complete design framework. The outcomes are applicable to large-scale residential buildings with regular layouts and similar structures like apartments and guesthouses.

#### Infrastructure of Yanqing Zong (Level 1/ Level 2 Pomping Station)
As the chief designer of the Pumping Station, I was proud to lead a project that won the Beijing Excellent Engineering Survey and Design Award. My work involved integrating critical infrastructure elements, such as snowmaking and water supply stations, into the mountain environment, carefully balancing functionality with landscape aesthetics. This project was a key part of the “Mountain Forest Venue, Ecological Winter Olympics,” and I’m honored that my design played a vital role in its success.

#### Conference Center of Central School of Communist Youth League of China 
As the main designer of Conference Center of Central School of Communist Youth League of China, I was honored to lead a project of high political significance. My work on this classified project required precision and a deep understanding of its symbolic importance. This effort was recognized with the prestigious CCTC Comprehensive Engineering Award, underscoring the impact and excellence of the design in meeting both the functional and symbolic needs of this vital institution.

#### Embassy of the People's Repulic of China in Malta
As the Structural Leader for the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Malta, I was responsible for the entire structural design of all buildings within the embassy compound. This highly classified, part military project was commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of PRC, highlighting the project’s critical importance and security requirements.

#### Harbin Snow Center
As one of the designers of Harbin Snow Center, I contributed to its Guinness World Record achievement as the “World’s Largest Snow and Ice Theme Park.” Our design seamlessly integrated vibrant ice sculptures with functional indoor spaces, creating a stunning, fairytale-like experience that captivated visitors last winter.
